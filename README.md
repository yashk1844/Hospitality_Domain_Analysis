Project Short Info :  

AtliQ Grands, with 2 decades in India's hospitality sector faces market share and revenue challenges in luxury/business hotels due to competition and management decisions, aiming for a resurgence.
My goal in this Project is to give them data driven insights so that they can take better decision.

Project Description:

In this project, the goal is to be one report which could be used by management team to make decisions. The focus is made on the following

1. User-empathetic Dashboard/ Report design
2. Drillable Insights

I learned the following things in this project -
a. Domain Knowledge
1. Hospitality domain key metrics - 
1. Total Available Rooms - Total number of rooms – Number of rooms out of order/not in service/out of inventory
2. RevPar(Revenue per Available Room ) - Total Room Revenue / Total Rooms Available
3. Average Daily Rate(ADR) - Rooms Revenue / Paid Rooms Occupied
4. Occupancy % - Paid Rooms Occupied / Rooms Available   
5. RevPar  = Occupancy %  *  ADR    therefore we can say RevPar <=  ADR 
6. SRN (Sellable room Nights) – Days * Total Available Rooms 
7. DSRN (Daily Sellable room Nights ) - Total Available Rooms 
8. URN (Utilized Room Nights) – customer stayed or Customer who checked out 
7. BRN – Total Bookings(customer stayed + No show + Cancelled)
8. Realization – URN / BRN
   
b. Python- 
1. Python basics - Data structures, Loops, Functions etc.
2. File Handling and Exceptional Handling
3. Object-oriented programming (OOPS ) - Classes, Objects, Inheritance
4. Python Libraries - Pandas, Numpy. Data visualization using matplotlib, seaborn.
5. Hospitality Domain Knowledge - Occupancy %, revenue realized, etc.
6. OLTP and OLAP
7. ETL - Data extraction(read, write excel & CSV files), Data cleaning(Handling NA Values ), Data transformation.
8. Insights Generation.

c. PowerBI
1.Power Query (Basic and Advanced Operations)
2.Basic and complex DAX formulas
3.Data modelling involving 10+ tables
4.Choosing the right visuals and formatting
5.Dashboard designing principles
6.Deploying in Power BI service
